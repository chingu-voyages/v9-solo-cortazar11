# v9-solo-cortazar11
This is my project for Voyage-9 of Chingu.

# Goal of my web
Initially I will call it BookAway.
It is kind of reverse-engineering of the web www.workaway.info, a web that build a sharing community of travellers who want to contribute to the places they visit. The web put in contact travellers looking for volunteering work in exchange of free accommodation and the hosters ready to take volunteers for a period of time.
I will try to put the content of that web in interface similar to www.booking.com. 

# Techniques to use
I will try to use what I know more:
- React framework to build the front-end.
- Redux for the management of the state in React.
- A node server in the server side of the app.
- Express framework in the server side for the http requests to node.
- MongoDB and mongoose library for the question of the persistence of the data.
